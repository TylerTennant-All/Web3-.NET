# .NET - Solidity
Connect smart contracts with .NET

In order to compile a smart contract i am using visual studio code with solidity extension. 
When compilation finish i use ABI and bin (bytecode) in C#. 
In addition i use the following tools to convert ABI to string:

and from multiline string to single line:

I will create different controllers for different cases.
In addition i will call functions from uniswap V3 dex.
